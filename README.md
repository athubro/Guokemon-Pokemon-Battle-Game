📖 The Origin Lore of Guokiman & the Crittermon Saga

🌩️ The Dumpling Awakening – The Birth of Guokiman
Once a mild-mannered math teacher, Mr. Guo was known for 1 thing:


his deadly silent quizzes.


One fateful day, while microwaving bao buns in the teacher’s lounge and trying to solve a four-variable algebraic proof, Guo miscalculated and caused a microwave explosion.
Instead of blowing up, the explosion opened a tiny rift in space-time…
 Guo was sucked in—along with his bao buns, calculator, and favorite pen—and emerged moments later as...
👉 GUOKIMAN – A tanky crittermon with explosive fists and a steamed-face glow.
 From then on, Guokiman wandered the school-verse, blasting students and teachers alike with Guo Blasts of doom.

📚 The Kuhn vs MicaManx Feud – The Handout Incident
Once a top student, Micah (now MicaManx) had one fateful week where he forgot his homework four days in a row.
 On the fifth day, Ms. Kuhn (now Laurune) dropped a Pop Quiz so soul-crushing, so filled with imaginary functions and implicit differentiation, that Micah’s brain collapsed into maximum sass mode.
He stormed out yelling, “Yo, I don’t even know what an asymptote is!!”
 A bolt of lightning struck him as he left. He woke up with a new power—and a new goal:
"Destroy Laurune. Burn the Handouts. Reclaim my GPA."
That’s why Laurune now does +50 bonus damage to MicaManx, and he deals -30 to her—it’s personal.

🔥 The Secret Rivalry – Guokiman vs Laurune
They used to be friends—teaching side-by-side and grading quizzes in harmony.
 But when Guo became Guokiman and started blowing things up, Kuhn couldn't stand the chaos.
 She told him:
“Quizzes build discipline. Explosions build nothing.”
Guokiman shot back with:
“Your quizzes are the real bombs.”
Since then, the school has split into Team Handout and Team Dumpling, and every time they meet in battle, they clash like steamed buns and multiple-choice tests.

🔥The Fall of Samulet: A Friendship Torn Apart
Once, Samulet and Akhilan were inseparable. Both were rising stars in their hometown, united by a love of strategy and adventure. Akhilan, a naturally gifted fighter, was always calm, collected, and focused. Samulet, on the other hand, was a wild card—quick-witted, unpredictable, and brilliant in ways that sometimes made him seem untouchable. Together, they were a perfect team: Akhilan's discipline and Samulet's creativity made them a force to be reckoned with.
Their bond was unshakeable—until one fateful night.
It was at a local underground event, a clandestine casino hidden in the heart of their town, that everything changed. Samulet, known for his sharp mind and luck, was drawn into the high-stakes world of gambling. The tables, the lights, the rush—it was intoxicating. Samulet quickly became a legend, winning countless games in a row, never losing a bet. But the more he won, the deeper his addiction grew. What started as a simple game of chance turned into a dangerous obsession.
Akhilan watched with growing concern as Samulet’s focus shifted from their friendship to the next gamble, the next win, the next risky roll. Samulet’s once sharp mind was clouded by the thrill of the game, and his reckless behavior began to strain their friendship. Akhilan, who had always kept a steady head, tried to intervene, but Samulet, in his delusional state, dismissed his concerns. He was untouchable. After all, his signature move Sammify was just a metaphor for the highs and lows of his new life—sometimes winning big, sometimes losing everything, but always living on the edge.
One day, Akhilan couldn’t take it anymore. After Samulet made a dangerous bet that put both their futures at risk, Akhilan made a difficult decision. He confronted Samulet one last time, urging him to leave the gambling world behind before it consumed him completely.
